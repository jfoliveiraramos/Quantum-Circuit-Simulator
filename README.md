# Quantum Circuit Simulator

A minimal (incredibly unoptimised) quantum circuit simulator built with NumPy and SciPy, developed as part of the **Scientific Computing in Quantum Information Science** course at the **Technical University of Denmark**.

This project focuses on implementing and simulating basic quantum circuits, such as the **quantum teleportation circuit**, from scratch using linear algebra primitives.

## Features

- Simulate quantum circuits via matrix operations  
- Supports common gates: `X`, `Y`, `Z`, `H`, `T`, `CNOT`, `CZ`  
- Tensor product-based multi-qubit simulation 
- Optional measurement and sampling  
- Modular structure to allow for future extensions (e.g., classes for Gates, States, Circuits)
